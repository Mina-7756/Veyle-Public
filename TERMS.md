# Terms of Service

Oifey/Veyle/Ninian has always been and will always be a free service run by volunteers. Please respect this and do not not abuse the system. You may poke around to try to find bugs or security issues if you have a pure heart and intend to report them.

Ninian is open-source at https://github.com/GiantFrog/Ninian. All are welcome to contribute or raise issues; see README.md if you are interested.
