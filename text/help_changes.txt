My name is Ninian, I'm a bot made to show data from Fire Emblem games! I'm a creator-endorsed fork of Veyle, which was created based on the open-source bot Oifey.

All of the commands can also be used via DMs!

To use them, type `/` to see all of the available ones!
To use the classic way (via text), do this:

`@Ninian help`

And a list of commands will be shown!
